- A classifier prediction system that interprets descriptive classifiers in sign language

### 5. Multi-Modal Visual Communication Platform

**Claim 5:** The system of claim 1, further comprising a multi-modal visual communication platform that:
- Supports multiple sign languages
- Facilitates visual-spatial information organization
- Enables persistent visual communication across devices
- Incorporates Deaf cultural norms in interface design

### 6. Authentication Method Claims

**Claim 6:** A method for authenticating users through sign language biometrics, comprising:
- Capturing a sequence of sign language movements using optical sensors
- Analyzing the movements against stored biometric profiles
- Verifying user identity based on signing style, rhythm, and spatial parameters
- Generating an authentication token upon successful verification
- Maintaining authentication persistence across an ecosystem of connected devices

### 7. Bidirectional Translation Method

**Claim 7:** A method for bidirectional translation between sign languages and spoken languages, comprising:
- Capturing sign language input through optical sensors
- Processing non-manual markers including at least 43 facial feature points
- Analyzing spatial grammar patterns in three-dimensional space
- Converting visual-spatial grammatical structures to linear language structures
- Generating synthetic voice output that preserves semantic and emotional content

### 8. Reverse Translation Method

**Claim 8:** The method of claim 7, further comprising:
- Capturing spoken language through audio sensors
- Analyzing linguistic structures of spoken input
- Converting linear language structures to visual-spatial grammatical structures
- Generating visual representation guidance for sign language output

### 9. Visual-Spatial Information Architecture

**Claim 9:** A system for visual-spatial information architecture, comprising:
- A spatial organization interface that presents information in three-dimensional visual space
- A visual memory mapping system that organizes information according to Deaf cognitive patterns
- A visual search engine optimized for spatial recall rather than text-based queries
- A collaborative visual workspace that enables multiple users to interact in shared visual space

### 10. Advanced Visual Processing
